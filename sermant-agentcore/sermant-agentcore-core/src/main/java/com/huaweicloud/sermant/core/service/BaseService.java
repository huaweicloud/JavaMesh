/**
 * Agent service interface
 * <p>
 * Service instances implementing {@link BaseService} is created when the agent starts, and after creating them, call
 * their {@link #start()} method in turn,
 * We also create hooks for them to invoke the {@link #stop()} method of the services at the end of the JVM
 * <p>
 * All {@link BaseService} instances will be managed by {@link ServiceManager}ï¼Œ
 * You can get the service instance by inputting the {@link BaseService} subclass through the
 * {@link ServiceManager#getService(Class)} method.
* {@link ServiceManager} returns the best implementation class based on the {@link BaseService} type input. You can set
 * the weight of multiple implementation classes with the SpiLoadUtils.SpiWeight annotation.
